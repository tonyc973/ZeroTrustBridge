2026-01-30 20:03:07,151 - [CLOUD_RESPONSE] To help you troubleshoot the issue with your database at `<IP_9877>` and user `<SECRET_2429>`, here's a checklist and some sample code snippets that might help you identify and resolve the problem:

1. **Check Database Connection:**
   Ensure that the database server is running and accessible.

   ```python
   import psycopg2

   try:
       connection = psycopg2.connect(
           database="your_database",
           user="<SECRET_2429>",
           password="<SECRET_1234>",  # Assuming you have a password
           host="<IP_9877>",
           port="5432"
       )
       print("Connection successful")
   except Exception as error:
       print("Error connecting to the database:", error)
   finally:
       if connection:
           connection.close()
   ```

2. **Verify Credentials:**
   Ensure that the username `<SECRET_2429>` and the associated password are correct. Sometimes, issues arise from incorrect credentials or expired passwords.

3. **Check Logs:**
   Examine the database server logs for any error messages that might provide additional context. Look for authentication errors or network issues.

4. **Firewall and Network Settings:**
   Ensure there are no firewall rules or network policies blocking the connection to `<IP_9877>`. You might want to try pinging the IP or using tools like `telnet` or `nc` to test connectivity on the database port.

5. **Database User Privileges:**
   Ensure that the user `<SECRET_2429>` has the appropriate privileges to access the database. You might need to log in as an admin and check the user's permissions:

   ```sql
   -- Connect to the database as an admin user
   SELECT * FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname='<SECRET_2429>';
   ```

6. **Database Service Status:**
   Verify that the database service is running on `<IP_9877>`. You may need to restart the service if it’s unresponsive.

If you follow these steps and check these areas, you should be able to diagnose the issue with your database connection. If the problem persists, consider consulting your database administrator or support team.
